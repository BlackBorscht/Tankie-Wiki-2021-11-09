# Tankie Wiki (November 9, 2021)
Latest archived copy of database dump for the Tankie Wiki project as of November 9, 2021 (2021-11-09). Title and file names are time-stamped so maintainers can upload the most recent archived copy.

## About the Project
>
>"This document is maintained by a small but diverse network of marxists, anarchists, progressives, and other aligned leftists. Everyone tends to work on their own little section independently or follows their own interests. Wherever possible native speakers have also included links in original languages or worked on sections relevant to their own backgrounds.
>
>We also include a range of different perspectives, wherever possible including state documents or the perspectives of communists and leftists from affected areas, so as to decentralize US-centric tankieism in left discourses. This goal is especially important around more pressing topics, such as genocide revisionism and the mass repression of complex social movements. We also hope to help update conversations around certain key events into the current moment.
>
>We trust the reader to employ critical thinking about the biases of any piece in this document and instead seek to form an understanding beyond the many different angles presented here. As much as possible, we attempt to name the biases of different outlets as stated in the accessibility description.
>
>The larger communities with which much of this information was developed are mostly not from the US, are heavily queer, and largely non-white/western."

## How to Archive
To archive a wiki hosted on Fandom, please check documentation under [Help:database download](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Database_download) on the Fandom website. It is simple as going to Special:Statistics then scrolling to bottom of the page to a header entitled "Database dumps".

Alternatively, there is an open-source archival tool from WikiTeam which an be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam) (which migrated from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/wikiteam/)) and [XOWA](http://xowa.org/), a   free and open-source application to view wikis on a computer without an Internet connection, [also provides instructions](http://xowa.org/home/wiki/App/Wiki_types/Wikia.com) on how to import database dumps from Fandom (formerly Wikia).

As an alternative to XOWA, you can also use [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org) to view the database dump offline.
